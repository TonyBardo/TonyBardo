After more than a decade in [academia](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/academic_cv.pdf), I'm transitioning to industry with a focus on transforming complex data into actionable insights. My background blends expertise in statistical modeling with a talent for storytelling that makes data understandable and meaningful.

üîç I‚Äôm especially passionate about:
- Wrangling messy real-world data to uncover patterns and drive decisions
- Designing rigorous analyses that yield practical value
- Bridging technical precision with clear compelling communication

I'm currently building an open portfolio to showcase how my academic foundation translates into industry by leveraging üõ†

### üìà My Journey through Data Analytics

My passion for data began in 2007 when I took a **team management** role in a Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) lab collecting survey data to analyze sleep patterns among retail food workers. This experience laid my foundation for building **end-to-end data pipelines** from raw data collection and quality assurance to data cleaning, transformation, and reporting. I developed a keen understanding of how to ensure **data integrity** and translate messy human-reported inputs into structured insights[<sup>1</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/2_Maume_Gender_Sleep_G%26S_2010.pdf) that inform real-world decisions[<sup>2</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/1_Maume_Gender_Sleep_ASR_2009.pdf).

I refined my ability to design and manage end-to-end data workflows collaborating with **government and industry stakeholders** in long-term services and supports (LTSS) to ensure that data-driven insights[<sup>3</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/5_Applebaum_CareMngt_JGCM_2014.pdf) were both accurate[<sup>4</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/R6_Mehdizadeh_OHCounty_2014.pdf) and actionable[<sup>5</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/R2_Mehdizadeh_PACE_tri_2009.pdf). My role involved **translating complex data** into forward-facing reports[<sup>6</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/R4_Applebaum_TransitionsS_2011.pdf) tailored to **drive improvements** in policy and practice[<sup>7</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/R5_Applebaum_TransitionsL_2011.pdf). This experience deepened my ability to align analytical work[<sup>8</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/6_Bardo_Transitions_JAG_2014.pdf) with the needs of **decision-makers** across sectors[<sup>9</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/C1b2_Applebaum_Global_2019.pdf).

My data work in LTSS led me to specialize in developing quantifiable quality-of-life metrics[<sup>10</sup>]( https://link.springer.com/journal/11205), which are equivalent to **key performance indicators (KPIs)**. I focused on how to measure[<sup>11</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/7_Bardo_DomSat_SIR_2014.pdf) and track[<sup>12</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/10_Bardo_Happy_APC_SPPS_2017.pdf) outcomes that matter most to people, organizations and systems, with insights grounded in meaningful data-driven indicators[<sup>13</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/11_Bardo_HappyDomSat_ALCR_2017.pdf). Through this work, I became internationally recognized for **designing and validating** data-driven performance indicators and was invited to contribute toward frameworks adopted by national statistical offices to **track development and policy goals**[<sup>14</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/New-Frontiers-in-Subjective-Well-being-Measurement-4-March-2024-Agenda.pdf).

I regularly **wrangle messy data** sources, including administrative records, primary surveys and qualitative interviews, into structured formats ready for analysis. I am fluent in **data preprocessing workflows** involving collection or extraction, recoding, merging, deduplication, and imputing missing values. I often integrate disparate data sources to produce holistic, actionable insights. For instance, I designed and oversaw the implimentation of an experimental approach aimed at enhancing performance indicator measurement for group-based interventions, which involved an end-to-end data workflow including survey data, social network data, and qualitative interviews[<sup>15</sup>]().

To extract deeper insights from structured data I typically apply a range of **statisical modeling** techniques, including: linear regression, generalized linear models (binary logit, ordinal logistic, multinomial logistic, hierarchical linear models, Poisson and negative binomial), survival/hazard models, and structural equation models (SEM). Guided by the principle of methodological parsimony, my approach to statistical modeling is pragmatic, such that I use the simplest method that gets the job done without sacrificing rigor. I am adept at translating complex statstical results in either written or oral formats to both technical and non-technical audiences. For example, much of my data work has centered around an interdisciplinary team-based approach, I have delivered dozens of presentations at national and international conferences, and I have taught quantiative methods for many years (see here for some examples of my courses: forthcoming).


üìÑ [2014 ‚Äì Domain Satisfaction Study](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/raw/main/papers/7_Bardo_DomSat_SIR_2014.pdf)  

During this period, I developed strong skills in:
- Data collection, cleaning, and management
- Statistical analysis and report writing
- Team science and interdisciplinary collaboration
- Communicating results to stakeholders and non-technical audiences

I took on increasling technial roles, working with large public datasets such as BRFSS, GSS, HRS, and MIDUS. Wrangling these complex data sources and wcollaborating with interdisciplinary teams required me to become proficient in tools like  **Excel**, **R**, **SAS**, **SPSS**, and **Stata**. 

One of my recent interdisciplinary projects involved designing a novel evaluation framework for an intervention study using customized social network analysis([repository and published study coming soon]). 

As I transition from academia into data science and analytics, I‚Äôm building an open portfolio to demonstrate how my quantitative expertise translates into actionable, business-relevant insights. These ongoing projects involve applying my technical skillset using tools like **SQL**, **PowerBI**, **Python**, and **Tableau**. While the tools of the trade are vast, my core strengths in analytical thinking, statistical modeling, and research design position me well to tackle a wide range of data-driven challenges.
