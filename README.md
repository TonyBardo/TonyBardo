### 🔬 About Me

After more than a decade in [academia](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/academic_cv.pdf), I'm transitioning to industry with a focus on transforming complex data into actionable insights. My background blends expertise in statistical modeling with a talent for storytelling that makes data understandable and meaningful.

🔍 I’m especially passionate about:
- Wrangling messy real-world data to uncover patterns and drive decisions
- Designing rigorous analyses that yield practical value
- Bridging technical precision with clear compelling communication

I'm currently building an open portfolio to showcase how my academic foundation translates into industry by leveraging 🛠

### 📈 My Journey through Data Analytics

My passion for data began in 2007 when I took a **team management** role in a Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) lab collecting survey data to analyze sleep patterns among retail food workers.

This experience laid my foundation for **building end-to-end data pipelines** from raw data collection and **quality assurance** to data cleaning, transformation, and reporting. I developed a keen understanding of how to ensure **data integrity** and translate messy [human-reported inputs](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/2_Maume_Gender_Sleep_G%26S_2010.pdf) into structured insights that [inform real-world decisions](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/1_Maume_Gender_Sleep_ASR_2009.pdf).

As my work evolved, I specialized in long-term services and supports (LTSS), where I refined my ability to design and manage end-to-end data workflows. I collaborated closely with **government and industry stakeholders** to ensure that [insights](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/5_Applebaum_CareMngt_JGCM_2014.pdf) were not just [accurate](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/R6_Mehdizadeh_OHCounty_2014.pdf) but also [actionable](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/R2_Mehdizadeh_PACE_tri_2009.pdf). 

My role involved **translating complex data** into [forward-facing reports](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/R4_Applebaum_TransitionsS_2011.pdf) tailored to **drive improvements** in long-term care [policy and practice](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/R5_Applebaum_TransitionsL_2011.pdf). This experience deepened my ability to align [analytical work](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/6_Bardo_Transitions_JAG_2014.pdf) with the needs of **decision-makers** [across sectors].


During this period, I developed strong skills in:
- Data collection, cleaning, and management
- Statistical analysis and report writing
- Team science and interdisciplinary collaboration
- Communicating results to stakeholders and non-technical audiences

I took on increasling technial roles, working with large public datasets such as BRFSS, GSS, HRS, and MIDUS. Wrangling these complex data sources and wcollaborating with interdisciplinary teams required me to become proficient in tools like  **Excel**, **R**, **SAS**, **SPSS**, and **Stata**. 

One of my recent interdisciplinary projects involved designing a novel evaluation framework for an intervention study using customized social network analysis([repository and published study coming soon]). 

As I transition from academia into data science and analytics, I’m building an open portfolio to demonstrate how my quantitative expertise translates into actionable, business-relevant insights. These ongoing projects involve applying my technical skillset using tools like **SQL**, **PowerBI**, **Python**, and **Tableau**. While the tools of the trade are vast, my core strengths in analytical thinking, statistical modeling, and research design position me well to tackle a wide range of data-driven challenges.
