### 🔬 About Me

After more than a decade in academia, I'm transitioning to industry with a focus on transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights. My background blends deep expertise in statistical modeling with a talent for storytelling—making data not just understandable, but meaningful.

🔍 I’m especially passionate about:
- Wrangling messy, real-world data to uncover patterns and drive decisions
- Designing rigorous analyses that yield practical value
- Bridging technical precision with clear, compelling communication

I'm currently building an open portfolio that showcases how my academic foundation translates into applied data science.

### 📈 My Journey into Data Analytics

My path began in a Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) lab, where I managed a team of interviewers and helped design a dataset used to uncover insights into sleep patterns among retail food workers.  
([repository and published study coming soon])

Soon after, I became the lead research associate on several state-sponsored projects focused on long-term services and supports for older adults and people with disabilities. These early career experiences grounded me in the full research lifecycle, from data collection and cleaning to advanced analysis and stakeholder communication.  
([repository and published study coming soon])

During this period, I developed strong skills in:
- Data collection, cleaning, and management
- Statistical analysis and report writing
- Team science and interdisciplinary collaboration
- Communicating results to stakeholders and non-technical audiences

I took on increasling technial roles, working with large public datasets such as BRFSS, GSS, HRS, and MIDUS. Wrangling these complex data sources and wcollaborating with interdisciplinary teams required me to become proficient in tools like  **Excel**, **R**, **SAS**, **SPSS**, and **Stata**. 

One of my recent interdisciplinary projects involved designing a novel evaluation framework for an intervention study using customized social network analysis([repository and published study coming soon]). 

As I transition from academia into data science and analytics, I’m building an open portfolio to demonstrate how my quantitative expertise translates into actionable, business-relevant insights. These ongoing projects involve applying my technical skillset using tools like **SQL**, **PowerBI**, **Python**, and **Tableau**. While the tools of the trade are vast, my core strengths in analytical thinking, statistical modeling, and research design position me well to tackle a wide range of data-driven challenges.
