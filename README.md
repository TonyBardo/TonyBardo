### 🔬 About Me

After more than a decade in academia ([CV](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/academic_cv.pdf)), I'm transitioning to industry with a focus on turning complex data into actionable real-world insights. My background blends a strong foundation in data storytelling with deep expertise in statistical modeling, making insights technically sound and widely accessible.

🔍 I’m especially passionate about:
- Wrangling messy real-world data to uncover patterns and drive decisions
- Designing rigorous analyses that yield practical value
- Bridging technical precision with clear compelling communication

I'm currently building an open portfolio to showcase how my expertise translates into problem solving using industry-standard tools 🛠

While tools may differ between academia and industry, the core logic of data wrangling, modeling, and storytelling are the same.

### 📈 My Data Analytics Journey

My passion for data began in 2007 when I took on a **team management** role collecting survey data among retail food workers. This taught me how to build **end-to-end data pipelines** from raw collection to transformation and reporting, and how to maintain **data integrity** when working with messy human-reported inputs.[<sup>1</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/2_Maume_Gender_Sleep_G%26S_2010.pdf)<sup>,</sup> [<sup>2</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/1_Maume_Gender_Sleep_ASR_2009.pdf) 

I'm fluent in every stage of **data preprocessing,** from extraction and recoding to deduplication, imputing missing values, and merging. I've regularly **wrangled unstructured data**, including administrative records, survey responses and qualitative interviews, into clean datasets.  

As my career progressed, I partnered with government and industry stakeholders in long-term services and supports,[<sup>3</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/5_Applebaum_CareMngt_JGCM_2014.pdf) delivering **forward-facing reports** that informed program strategy, operations, and policy.[<sup>4</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/R4_Applebaum_TransitionsS_2011.pdf)<sup>,</sup> [<sup>5</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/R5_Applebaum_TransitionsL_2011.pdf) These collaborations deepened my ability to design and manage **scalable data workflows**[<sup>6</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/R6_Mehdizadeh_OHCounty_2014.pdf)<sup>,</sup> [<sup>7</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/R2_Mehdizadeh_PACE_tri_2009.pdf) and to communicate clearly with diverse technical and non-technical audiences across sectors.[<sup>8</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/6_Bardo_Transitions_JAG_2014.pdf)<sup>,</sup> [<sup>9</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/C1b2_Applebaum_Global_2019.pdf).

Over time, I developed a specialization in quantifiable quality-of-life metrics, which are equivalent to **key performance indicators (KPIs)**.[<sup>10</sup>]( https://link.springer.com/journal/11205) Along these lines, I focused on how to **measure and track outcomes** that matter most to people, organizations and systems.[<sup>11</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/7_Bardo_DomSat_SIR_2014.pdf)<sup>,</sup> [<sup>12</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/10_Bardo_Happy_APC_SPPS_2017.pdf)<sup>,</sup> [<sup>13</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/11_Bardo_HappyDomSat_ALCR_2017.pdf) My contributions led to invitations to help shape international frameworks used by national statistical offices to track development goals. [<sup>14</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/New-Frontiers-in-Subjective-Well-being-Measurement-4-March-2024-Agenda.pdf)

My public-facing work has been featured in major media outlets, where I translated research findings for general audiences.[<sup>15</sup>](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/now-more-of-us-can-count-on-more-time-dodging-the-dementia-bullet/), [<sup>16</sup>](https://www.prb.org/resources/happily-ever-after-research-offers-clues-on-what-shapes-happiness-and-life-satisfaction-after-age-65/), [<sup>17</sup>](https://www.niussp.org/health-and-mortality/racial-disparities-in-disability-and-in-long-and-happy-living-in-america/)

To extrat actionable insights, I've applied a wide range of **statistical modeling** techniques, including:
- linear regression
- generalized linear models (logit, logistic, hierarchical, Poisson and negative binomial)
- survival/hazard models

My deep expertise in **quantitative methods** is also demonstrated by my methodological summaries[<sup>18</sup>](extensive) and teaching experience.

Ultimately, the 🛠 tools are only as 💪 powerful as the 🧑‍💻 person using them. I bring rich experience in analytical thinking, research design, and data storytelling that has equiped me to solve complex problems and deliver actionable insights, no matter the tools or setting.

### 📈 Projects

I’ve led projects that integrated **disparate datasets** to generate holistic, actionable insights. For instance, I designed and led an experimental approach to improve performance measurement for group-based interventions, combining survey data, social network analysis (SNA), and qualitative interviews and focus groups in a full-cycle evaluation[<sup>#</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/Manuscript_JHSE_v2.pdf).


🚀 **[US Health Profile (BRFSS 2021–2023)](https://github.com/tonybardo/brfss-etl)**
- R + Tableau project visualizing chronic conditions across SES and geography
- Includes ETL pipeline, harmonized layout files, and interactive dashboards
