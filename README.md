### 🔬 About Me

After more than a decade in academia, I'm transitioning to industry with a focus on turning complex data into actionable insights. My background combines expertise in statistical modeling with a talent for storytelling that makes data understandable and meaningful.

🔍 I’m especially passionate about:
- Wrangling messy real-world data to uncover patterns and drive decisions
- Designing rigorous analyses that yield practical value
- Bridging technical precision with clear compelling communication

I'm currently building a portfolio to show how my expertise translate into real-world problem solving using industry-standard tools 🛠

While the tools may differ between academia and industry, the core logic of data wrangling, modeling, and insight generation are the same.

### 📈 My Data Analytics Journey

My passion for data began in 2007 when I took on a **team management** role collecting survey data among retail food workers. This taught me how to build **end-to-end data pipelines** from collection and transformation to reporting, and how to maintain **data integrity** when working with messy human-reported inputs.[<sup>1</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/2_Maume_Gender_Sleep_G%26S_2010.pdf)<sup>,</sup> [<sup>2</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/1_Maume_Gender_Sleep_ASR_2009.pdf) 

In my next roles, I partnered with government and industry in long-term services and supports,[<sup>3</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/5_Applebaum_CareMngt_JGCM_2014.pdf) delivering **forward-facing reports** that informed program strategy, operations, and policy.[<sup>4</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/R4_Applebaum_TransitionsS_2011.pdf)<sup>,</sup> [<sup>5</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/R5_Applebaum_TransitionsL_2011.pdf) These collaborations deepened my ability to design and manage **scalable data workflows**[<sup>6</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/R6_Mehdizadeh_OHCounty_2014.pdf)<sup>,</sup> [<sup>7</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/R2_Mehdizadeh_PACE_tri_2009.pdf) and to communicate clearly with diverse technical and non-technical stakeholders across sectors.[<sup>8</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/6_Bardo_Transitions_JAG_2014.pdf)<sup>,</sup> [<sup>9</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/C1b2_Applebaum_Global_2019.pdf).

Over time, I specialized in quantifiable quality-of-life metrics, which are equivalent to **key performance indicators (KPIs)**.[<sup>10</sup>]( https://link.springer.com/journal/11205) I focused on how to **measure and track outcomes** that matter most to people, organizations and systems.[<sup>11</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/7_Bardo_DomSat_SIR_2014.pdf)<sup>,</sup> [<sup>12</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/10_Bardo_Happy_APC_SPPS_2017.pdf)<sup>,</sup> [<sup>13</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/11_Bardo_HappyDomSat_ALCR_2017.pdf) My contributions led to invitations to support national statistical offices that rely on these indicators to assess global development goals. [<sup>14</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/New-Frontiers-in-Subjective-Well-being-Measurement-4-March-2024-Agenda.pdf)

I'm fluent in every stage of **data preprocessing,** including extraction, recoding, merging, deduplication, and imputing missing values. I regularly **wrangled unstructured data**, including administrative records, surveys responses and qualitative interviews, into clean datasets that I've analyzed with a range of methods from exploratory descriptive summaries to inferential **statistical modeling,** including:
- linear regression
- generalized linear models (logit, logistic, hierarchical, Poisson and negative binomial)
- survival/hazard models

My extensive background in **quantitative methods** is further evidenced by my methodological summaries[<sup>15</sup>](extensive) and teaching materials.

With frequent presentations at national and international conferences and dozens of written reports ([CV](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/academic_cv.pdf)), I’m adept at **communicating technical findings**. My public-facing work has also been featured in major media outlets, where I translated research findings for general audiences.[<sup>15</sup>](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/now-more-of-us-can-count-on-more-time-dodging-the-dementia-bullet/), [<sup>16</sup>](https://www.prb.org/resources/happily-ever-after-research-offers-clues-on-what-shapes-happiness-and-life-satisfaction-after-age-65/), [<sup>17</sup>](https://www.niussp.org/health-and-mortality/racial-disparities-in-disability-and-in-long-and-happy-living-in-america/)

My foundation in analytical thinking, research design, and data storytelling equips me to solve complex problems regardless of the software. Ultimately, the 🛠 tools are only as 💪 powerful as the 🧑‍💻 person using them.

### 📈 Projects

I’ve led projects that integrated **disparate datasets** to generate holistic, actionable insights. For instance, I designed and led an experimental approach to improve performance measurement for group-based interventions, combining survey data, social network analysis (SNA), and qualitative interviews and focus groups in a full-cycle evaluation[<sup>#</sup>](https://github.com/TonyBardo/TonyBardo/blob/main/papers/Manuscript_JHSE_v2.pdf).


🚀 **[US Health Profile (BRFSS 2021–2023)](https://github.com/tonybardo/brfss-etl)**
- R + Tableau project visualizing chronic conditions across SES and geography
- Includes ETL pipeline, harmonized layout files, and interactive dashboards
